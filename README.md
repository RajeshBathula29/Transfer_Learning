## Transfer Learning for Gender Classification
üåü This repository focuses on implementing transfer learning to classify images and predict gender (male or female). The code utilizes the ResNet model and achieves an impressive accuracy of over 94% within a few epochs. üöÄ

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the "Gender Recognition 200K Images" dataset from Kaggle. You can find the dataset here. It contains a large collection of images for training and testing our gender classification model.

## Code Explanation
  Here is a step-by-step explanation of the code:

    1Ô∏è‚É£ Download and Unzip Dataset: In the first step, you need to download the dataset from the Kaggle link provided. To access the dataset, you'll need to have the kaggle.json file, which can be obtained from your Kaggle account. Unzip the downloaded file to get the dataset ready for use.

    2Ô∏è‚É£ GPU Acceleration: Ensure that you are running the code on a GPU-enabled system to leverage its computational power and accelerate the training process.

    3Ô∏è‚É£ Dataset Preparation: Use the os library to familiarize yourself with the dataset's file paths and determine the dataset's size (number of images). This step will help you understand the dataset structure and organize it for further processing.

    4Ô∏è‚É£ Preprocessing: Utilize TensorFlow's preprocessing class to preprocess the dataset and prepare it as input for our model. This may involve tasks such as resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and augmenting the data to enhance model performance.

    5Ô∏è‚É£ Model Selection: Define the URLs of the models available on TensorFlow Hub. TensorFlow Hub provides a repository of pre-trained models that can be used for transfer learning. Choose a suitable model architecture for your gender classification task.

    6Ô∏è‚É£ Model Creation: Create a function to build the model, which takes the model URL and the number of classes (in this case, 2: male and female) as inputs. This function will handle the loading of the pre-trained model and adapt it to the gender classification task.

    7Ô∏è‚É£ Model Training: Create an instance of the model and fit the preprocessed data to it. Train the model for a few epochs (e.g., 3 epochs) to allow it to learn from the dataset and improve its accuracy.

    8Ô∏è‚É£ Visualization: Utilize Matplotlib to plot accuracy and loss curves, enabling you to visualize how the model is performing during training. These plots provide insights into the model's learning progress and help identify any potential issues.

    9Ô∏è‚É£ Prediction Evaluation: Make predictions on the validation dataset using the trained model and evaluate its performance. This step allows you to assess the model's accuracy and see how well it classifies gender based on new, unseen images.
